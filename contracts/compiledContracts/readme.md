**Compiled SmartContracts**

SmartContracts are compiled using [https://www.npmjs.com/package/solc](#Solc Node.js) Library. All versions are properly compiled and managed. After compiling SmartContracts using Solc they return Compiled Data of that smartContract like ABI, Binary Code and opcode, which are used later by our Platform and our developers. Those types of files are stored in this folder in JSON format.
